import uuid from 'uuid' //to handle unique ID generation. With this refactor, since we are creating an author ID from within the reducer instead of in AuthorInput.js, we need to import it here as well.


//Through combineReducer, we're telling Redux to produce a reducer which will return a state that has both a key of books with a value equal to the return value of the booksReducer() and a key of authors with a value equal to the return value of the authorsReducer(). Now if you look at the booksReducer() and the authorsReducer() you will see that each returns a default state of an empty array.
